第二章　端緒

　知らないベルの音だ。

　まどろみの中でそう思った。目覚まし？　でも、俺はまだ眠いのだ。昨夜は絵を描くのに夢中になっていて、ベッドに入ったのは明け方だったのだ。

「……くん。……たきくん」

　今度は、誰かに名を呼ばれている。女の声。……女？

#+end_example

into an HTML page like this:

[[sample.png]]

where only words that you don't know are enhanced with furigana and brief English translation. It also adds links to
automatic translators for every line (it should be sentence, but that is for the future)

** Warning

*BIG, BIG, warning.*

This is work in progress. At this point, it is a proof of concept and not user friendly.

You need command line skills to be able to do this. It is not difficult.

I recommend you start by using one of the databases provided. Once you have it running, you can create your own database.



* Requirements

** You must have the MIA dictionary add on installed.

  - Make sure you have installed the JMdict, Japanese-> English

** You must have the MecabUnidic  installed (the _latest_).

The best way to know if you have the latest is to check the size of the file

   Anki2/addons21/MecabUnidic/support/matrix.bin

     its size should be: 485047608

  *eiganize will only work with this version of the Mecab dictionary*

** Python3

It works with Python3, except for the optional step, which requires python3.8

** Some basic knowledge of running commands from the command line


* Optional step: create your own database of morphs

   This requires:
     - sqlite3
     - python3.8 or later
     - csvutils

1. clone this repository:
   https://github.com/dmgerman/MorphMan

  It has a script that you need to extract your morphs database. This code is not yet
  merged into morphman, but it should be soon.

2. Extract your database

   Find your known.db in morphan (it is inside your anki data directory). Mine is located in
  /home/dmg/.local/share/Anki2/dmg/dbs/known.db (dmg is my username in anki). Copy this file.

  Run the following command

  python3.8 .../MorphMan/scripts/dumb_db.py known.db | csvcut -t > mine.csv

  this will create a csv file with the output of Morphs

  now import into sqlite3 by running. I call the output database mine.db

  #+begin_src sh
  sqlite3 mine.db
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src sql
.import 'mine.csv' known
CREATE INDEX wordsin on known(inflected);
CREATE INDEX wordsbase on known(base);
CREATE INDEX wordsbnorm on known(norm);
select * from known limit 10;
  #+end_src

If everything works, you shoud see a list  of the 10 morphs. Exit it with Ctrl-D

* Installation

** Step 1. Test you can run mecab

For the next steps I'll assume that you are trying to "eiganaize" the file yourName.txt
found in the directory tests.

MecabUnidic comes with binaries for the 3 main ones (linux, macos and windows). The name of the binary
is mecab.lin, mecab and mecab.exe. Adjust accordingly. I'll use the linux version in this example:

move to the directory addons21/MecabUnidic/support/ of anki and run:

where <fullpath> is the location where yourName is:

#+begin_src sh
./mecab.lin -d . -r ./mecabrc < <fullpath>/yourName.txt
#+end_src


The output should end with the following 5 lines:

#+begin_example
は	助詞,係助詞,*,*,*,*,ハ,は,は,ワ,は,ワ,和,*,*,*,*,*,*,係助,ハ,ハ,ハ,ハ,*,"動詞%F2@0,名詞%F1,形容詞%F2@-1",*,8059703733133824,29321
叫ん	動詞,一般,*,*,五段-バ行,連用形-撥音便,サケブ,叫ぶ,叫ん,サケン,叫ぶ,サケブ,和,*,*,*,*,*,*,用,サケン,サケブ,サケン,サケブ,2,C1,*,3869190075327109,14076
だ	助動詞,*,*,*,助動詞-タ,終止形-一般,タ,た,だ,ダ,だ,ダ,和,*,*,*,*,*,*,助動,ダ,ダ,ダ,ダ,*,動詞%F2@1,*,5948924875645611,21642
。	補助記号,句点,*,*,*,*,*,。,。,*,。,*,記号,*,*,*,*,*,*,補助,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,6880571302400,25
EOS
#+end_example

If you see less columns in the output you have the wrong version of Mecab.

I have created a script that runs in Linux but needs to be customized. See mecab/runMecab.sh


** Step 2. Configure the  location of the MIA dictionary

Look at config.py and configure accordingly. You should be able to open the miaDicLocation file using sqlite3 or sqlitebrowser


* eiganize your file:

these steps use yourName.txt as an example using the tangoN5 database provided under dbs.
Use your database otherwise.

** Step 1. Run mecab on the file you want to eiganize


Using mecab (see above) convert your file:

#+begin_src sh
./mecab.lin -d . -r ./mecabrc < <fullpath>/yourName.txt > <fullpath>/yourName.mecab
#+end_src


** Step 2: create the HTML file:

the first parameter is the mecab file, the second the origianal file, the third the database to use

#+begin_src sh
./eiganize.py test/yourName.mecab test/yourName.txt dbs/tangoN5.db
#+end_src

This should output HTML... you can save this output via redirection:

#+begin_src sh
./eiganize.py test/yourName.mecab test/yourName.txt dbs/tangoN5.db  > test/yourName.html
#+end_src

Now you can load the file test/yourName.html in your browser. For some reason, Yomichan is disabled in my browser for local files. I have to put the files in a Web server to be able to use the extension.
If anybody knows how to fix this, I'll appreciate it.
